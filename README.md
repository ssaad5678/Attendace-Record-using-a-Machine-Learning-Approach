# Real-Time Face Recognition Attendance System üì∏üë•‚úÖ

## Introduction ‚ÑπÔ∏è

Welcome to the Real-Time Face Recognition Attendance System! This program utilizes computer vision and machine learning techniques to recognize faces in real-time captured by a webcam and mark attendance automatically. It uses the face_recognition library in Python along with OpenCV for face detection and recognition.

## Features ‚ú®

- **Real-Time Face Detection:** The program detects faces in real-time using a webcam feed.
- **Face Recognition:** It recognizes faces by comparing them with known faces from a dataset.
- **Automatic Attendance Marking:** Upon recognizing a face, the program automatically marks attendance with a timestamp.

## How It Works üöÄ

1. **Data Preparation:** Prepare a dataset of images containing faces of individuals whose attendance needs to be tracked. Ensure the images are named appropriately.
2. **Encoding Faces:** Encode the faces in the dataset using face_recognition library, which converts them into numerical representations.
3. **Real-Time Detection:** Capture frames from the webcam feed and detect faces in each frame using OpenCV.
4. **Face Recognition:** Compare the detected faces with the encoded faces from the dataset to recognize individuals.
5. **Attendance Marking:** Mark attendance by recording the name and timestamp of recognized individuals in a CSV file.

## Setup and Usage üõ†Ô∏è

1. Clone the repository or download the program file (`attendance_system.py`).
2. Ensure you have Python installed on your system along with the required libraries (OpenCV, numpy, face_recognition).
3. Prepare a dataset folder (`ImagesAttendance`) containing images of individuals' faces.
4. Run the program using Python:
    ```bash
    python attendance_system.py
    ```
5. The program will start capturing frames from your webcam, detect faces, recognize individuals, and mark attendance automatically.
